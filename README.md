# AutoSort

Before compiling, be sure to: 
1) change the paths. 
2) Create a folder 'images' and add your images(At random)
3) be sure to add 3-4 images which have been taken on the same day or days below 2-3 days of difference.

Create a Program to sort images and videos which are uploaded:

 1) based on the 'Date taken' 
 2) create a separate folder for each trip
    -- one way to do this is by checking if the diffrence between 2 pictures is more than 2 or 3 days
 3) One day, one subfolder in trip's folder
 4) Default: Unsorted folder
 5) Quick GUI for putting unsorted images into a folder/subfolder
    -- Darg and drop?
