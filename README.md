## Create a Program to sort images and videos which are uploaded:

 1) based on the 'Date taken' 
 2) create a separate folder for each trip
    -- one way to do this is by checking if the diffrence between 2 pictures is more than 2 or 3 days
 3) One day, one subfolder in trip's folder
 4) Default: Unsorted folder
 5) Quick GUI for putting unsorted images into a folder/subfolder
